## Smoke and Mirrors
* Works without requiring vertical styling
* Margins done
* Edge cases with large amounts of items
* Working on horizontal collections next

## Flexi
* Scrolling
	* warn user if not set up to grow correctly
* Offsets, AST walker width vs min-width?
	* Kyle will make an example twiddle showing the current issues to determine if we can make a workaround until browsers fix this bug 
* Try to warn users when they do anything wrong, would be a huge win for layout framework
* Plan for future, do graph and make minimum CSS classes to make smaller payload sizes, using rulesets, etc
* Can sanity check CSS with the graph
