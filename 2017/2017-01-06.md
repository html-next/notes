### Splitting up Flexi ###

Would be great to add a master issue with a checklist where people can grab components to split out.
Would be great to have a short list of the relevant parts so people can hit the ground running.

Current status/questions:
- sustain - https://github.com/html-next/flexi/pull/106
- flexi-builtime - just the stuff in lib/? Maybe the stuff in dsl/? Maybe the stuff in addon/styles/?
- flexi-runtime - ./addon/lib/monitor.js... anything else?
- flexi-layouts - Container mixin and its implementers? Maybe the stuff in dsl/ (besides dsl-defaults)? How about the stuff in lib/?
- default-dsl - is this just the single file in dsl/?

Where should the stuff under styles fall? Buildtime? Layouts?

**Actionable: Kyle will make an issue for this**

### Documentation ###

Per RWW: Consider readme.io for docs

Buy-in from RWW, Mel, and Kyle

**Punting until buy-in from Chris**

### Offsets are still broken ###

Max-width is required for elements that wrap, else they grow to fit their row (do not respect width property). Chris mentioned having a potential fix.

**Punting until more details from Chris**

### Scroll performance ###

In the notes from last time, don't recall what this is about/what the actionables are

**Punting until more details from Chris**

### "Interaction of all this raf" ###

In the notes from last time, I think this was in regards to using Igniter in Flexi?

Are there actionables for us yet? Maybe an issue regarding merging igniter which we can track with an issue of our own?

**Punting until more details from Chris**

### Can we build separately for each layout size on it's own? ###

Are there actionables for this? A necessary RFC was mentioned in the last meeting.

Would be great to throw up an issue for this mentioning the current blockers.

**Actionable: Mel will create an issue with details.**
